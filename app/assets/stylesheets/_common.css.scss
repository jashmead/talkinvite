/*
  common variables for use by talkinvite scss files
  @import common.css.scss; to use
  leading '_' to make clear it is a 'partial' in sass terms

  have tried marking talks with background-color light blue, 
    but it is a) not very light & b) distracting
    -- maybe a much lighter blue?
    -- borders?
    -- keep experimenting

  for now, this file is available for common stuff but not yet in use
