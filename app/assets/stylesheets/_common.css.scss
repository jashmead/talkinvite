  leading '_' to make clear it is a 'partial' in sass terms

  have tried marking talks with background-color light blue, 
    but it is a) not very light & b) distracting
    -- maybe a much lighter blue?
    -- borders?
    -- keep experimenting

  headings are too far to the right for current sizing
    -- either shift to the left, or set the page width smaller
