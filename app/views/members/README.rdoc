=== Member Views

Starting with the usual set, but really need:

1. accept/decline/maybe
1. admin/unadmin
1. show (with individual talk, person)
1. index -- for a list of the members in a talk, or memberships a person has

do not need edit, since the only thing you can do with a membership is change the status

delete is done when talk or person is deleted, and only then
