== Database Issues

Can't reset database due to dependencies among tables, but:
1.  can rebuild however
1.  make sure that database & all tables owned by talkinvite 
1.  use "kill -15" to terminate dead but blocking procs
1.  to get plsql language back in will need to run top of structure.sql as postgres
1.  use rake db:seed to reseed
1.  good way to reorder columns
