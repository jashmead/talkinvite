== Testing Philosphy

* TDD -- test driven design
* DRY -- don't repeat yourself, but not to point of chafing :)
* YAGNI -- you ain't gonna need it

=== Artillerist's approach

1. on -- before writing code
1. over/under -- make sure negatives not hit
1. impact -- make sure not just hit but correct
1. fragmentation -- make sure links correct (how to test?)
