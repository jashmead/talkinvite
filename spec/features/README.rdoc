=== Feature Tests

The features directory is supposed to work better with capybara tests 
- seems to make no difference however.

Stories_pages_spec.rb is a kind of road map of the applications, as it is expected to be used.

The per model files here are for testing at a semantic level; in terms of higher level interactions.
We aren't sure how well this works in practice; we'll see.
